  project: PolicyEngine POSE
  version: 2026-01
  description: "Tell the story" — tech-forward, open-source research org
  entity_type: 501(c)(3) / UK Charity
  mission: >
    Focused research organization. Like Urban/Mathematica but better —
    tech-forward, open source, model-oriented. Uses best-in-class
    infrastructure (Cosilico) and focuses entirely on research impact.
  note: >
    PolicyEngine USES Cosilico infrastructure (Rules API, Microsim API)
    but its core mission is research and analysis, not infrastructure.
