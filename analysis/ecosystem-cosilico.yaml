# ============ KEY ASSUMPTIONS TO TEST ============

assumptions:
  - id: gov_oss_adoption
    statement: Government agencies will buy open-source rules infrastructure
    alternative: Too much procurement/regulatory overhead; incumbents win on inertia
    test_via: pilot projects, interviews with state IT directors

  - id: tax_software_api_pricing
    statement: Tax software vendors prefer API at $0.02/household vs building internally
    alternative: Internal engines are cheaper at scale, switching cost too high
    test_via: enterprise sales conversations, price sensitivity analysis

  - id: financial_services_api
    statement: Financial services will pay for precise tax calculation APIs
    alternative: Approximations are "good enough" for planning tools
    test_via: enterprise sales, pilot integrations

  - id: ai_labs_verifier
    statement: AI labs will pay for verifiable policy ground truth signals
    alternative: Labs build own policy knowledge or don't prioritize policy accuracy
    test_via: partnership discussions, compute-for-API trades

  - id: microplex_accuracy
    statement: Microplex synthetic data is accurate enough for commercial use
    alternative: Synthetic data too noisy for lending/insurance decisions
    test_via: accuracy benchmarks, customer validation, regulatory review

# ============ MARKET SIZING ============
