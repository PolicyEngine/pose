# I-Corps for POSE Course Schedule

## Winter 2026 Cohort (January - March 2026)

**Note: All times are Eastern Time**

---

## Program overview

The I-Corps for POSE program consists of three modules:

### Module 1: Four-day kickoff

This initial workshop introduces teams to the approach, the Teaching Team, and your peers. Teams will also meet members of your ecosystem and present what they learn to the class. During each presentation, the Teaching Team will offer observations and guidance intended to help all teams in the cohort.

Throughout the course, teams must get out of the building and test open source ecosystem model assumptions. Each team must conduct at least 100 interviews, which equates to approximately 15 interviews per week over the seven weeks. Teams are also required to record data from the interviews using our Course Management Software or other system. The Teaching Team may limit presentation time if a team does not meet the required interview number for the class. Teams only receive "credit" for the interviews recorded in the Course Management Software and those interviews conducted between the first kickoff day and the last day of the program.

### Module 2: Five weekly online classes

During the period between the Kickoff and Lessons Learned workshops, teams attend weekly online classes (5 total). Teams present lessons learned from their interviews, receive guidance from the Teaching Team, and participate in a weekly discussion about one of the ecosystem model components (noted in the assignments for each class).

### Module 3: Two-day lessons learned final presentations

This two-day final workshop allows teams to present summaries of their lessons learned and to share expected "next steps" regarding their projects. Teams will also meet individually with the Teaching Team to discuss their project plans.

### Office hours

Weekly office hours are mandatory during the first week and available throughout the course. These sessions allow for specific and individual responses to your questions and comments. The teaching assistant will guide you on registering for these meetings.
