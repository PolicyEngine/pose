## Guidance for the POSE Final Presentations

### Next week's sessions

You will have two sessions next week. Finale Session 1 will be with your
instructor and will focus on getting your final presentation in order.
Please arrive with a draft of your final presentation and prepare to do
a dry run. During Finale Session 2, your team will deliver your formal
final presentation. More information will be provided as we get closer.

### The Audience for your Final Presentations

**NSF**: The NSF is very interested in seeing your final presentations.
Their interest in your performance is related to your completing 100
interviews, what you learned from those interviewees, and how that has
changed or reinforced your strategies to build your Open Source
Ecosystems.

**Fellow POSE Teams**: The entire cohort is present for the final
presentations. You have heard some of the teams present before, but the
teams really don't know each other. Your job is to bring all the
participants along on your journey. Make sure that you grab their
attention and make your activities and learning relevant to them. The
faculty will help you tune this up as you work through Thursday's
session.

**Philanthropists and Other Funders**: Our sessions are private and not
open to outside individuals but we would like you to imagine this as a
practice session for when you might meet people from a foundation,
corporate partner, or other potential funder. Consider why they might
fund you (think Impact!) and tune your presentation to make the relevant
points.

**The Faculty**: Your assigned faculty knows your team well and would
love to help you make a great presentation. The other faculty are also
interested in hearing the potential of your project in your words and in
the words of your potential community. We want you to show your plans,
your results, and how you build your sustainability and impact based on
the information from your interviews.

### Required Slides and Structure

You will have 8-minutes to complete your final presentation. We have
asked for all the slides that you have presented during the course -
PLEASE UPDATE ALL YOUR SLIDES. See the syllabus for the final slide
requirements

We suggest starting with all your final slides in your appendix section.
These slides are required for your final presentation, you do not have
to use them all. If you want to use one of those slides, please move it
to the presentation section of your deck.

### Story

Keep in mind that a small number of people in your audience know of you
or your project. Hook them at the beginning and clearly describe the
problem you are solving.

- Please add slides that convey your story. Use images, quotes from
  interviews, illustrations of "a-ha" moments, etc. Do not use text
  heavy slides unless absolutely necessary.

- Tell a story of what you did and what you learned (include real quotes
  from your interviews!) during the program.

- Focus on aggregate insights rather than singular data points (please
  use single data points if they illustrate something important)

- Highlight your "a-ha!" moment(s) along with low or high moments that
  you experienced during the seven weeks.

- Use brief and legible text (i.e., large enough to be read when shown
  on Zoom)

Our storytelling session emphasized the effect of telling a great
story - and you all have great stories to tell. Telling them in
presentation form takes time and practice. Keep the STAR in mind -
Stories They will Always Remember. Those stories might be the story of
you or your team, the impact of your technology in the context of a
user, an interview's revelation to you, and stories of what you did and
what you learned (include real quotes from your interviews!).

A simple story is often structured around the problem your users have
and how you solve their problem. That links to your impact statement (if
we are successful, the world is better because\...). And you know that
is real because of concrete data that you have developed from your
interviews (this part takes you out of the abstract into concrete land).
Then you know you need to build the following (your plan) to achieve a
greater impact. That plan has an organization (your OSE canvas) and a
timeline and a need for resources (contributors, funding, continued work
by your unsung maintainers and creators, etc.).

Your presentation should be a dynamic and engaging delivery of your
team's stories; it should not be a simple narration of slides or
findings. Please include an ask or call to action. The cohort is your
community - what would you like from them? How much funding do you need?
Who do you need introductions to for help?
