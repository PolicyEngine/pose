This is a representation of all the slides you will produce during this
course. You will be told which slides to produce for each day they are
required. You may find it beneficial to create a full set of slides at
the start of the program and then refine them over the entire session.
While some may be due during specific sessions, please complete as many
as possible as early as possible. The insights you receive from your
qualitative research data should cause you to update these slides each
week.

Please modify these slides, templates, or documents to fit your needs
and your formats.
