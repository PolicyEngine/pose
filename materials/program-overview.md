## Overview

The program will be led by experienced instructors and supported by a teaching assistant. The teaching team will be introduced during the onboarding session.

This course requires in-depth preparation and significant effort above and beyond your daily responsibilities. Your participation is required as part of your POSE award.

This program is exclusively available to teams who have a Phase I or II POSE grant from the NSF.

### Program Structure

- **Pre-Program Orientation:** One-hour virtual orientation
- **Kickoff Workshop:** Four-day intensive workshop
- **Weekly Online Classes:** Five weekly online sessions (Block A 10-12 or Block B 11-1 PM ET)
- **Lessons Learned Workshop:** Two-day final workshop

This course facilitates real-world, experiential learning for Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystem (POSE) teams, enhancing the likelihood of developing successful products and processes with societal benefits and impactful outcomes. Participants will interview a diverse array of stakeholders pertinent to their project, encompassing **users, supporters, contributors, competitors, distributors, and partners**. The primary focus of this curriculum is to engage in direct, field-based research to comprehend and cultivate a sustainable open-source ecosystem.

## Required Attendance and Participation

- All Team members must attend **ALL sessions** of the Kickoff, online classes, Lessons Learned workshop, and office hours with the faculty.

- If any Team member anticipates missing a class during the course, the Team must obtain NSF approval. NSF will not approve absences once the course starts (except for unexpected personal or family emergencies).

- Each Team member must agree to the required class time **plus at least 8-10 additional weekly hours** for Ecosystem Discovery. The ecosystem discovery interviews are a core part of your obligations to this program. Past participants have found them to radically reshape their views of their Open Source Ecosystem.

## Deliverables Summary

The course has a cadence to its deliverables. Your team is accountable for the following deliverables:

### Ecosystem Discovery Interviews

By the end of the program, your team needs to complete **at least 100 interviews** with people both inside and outside your open source ecosystem. You will need to document those interviews by capturing basic contact information, but more importantly, the learning from each and the synthesis of the entire data.

#### Interview Pacing Milestones

| Milestone | Total Interview Count |
|-----------|----------------------|
| End of the Kickoff Week | 10 |
| Weekly Session 1 | 25 |
| Weekly Session 2 | 40 |
| Weekly Session 3 | 55 |
| Weekly Session 4 | 70 |
| Weekly Session 5 | 85 |
| Finale Presentation | 100 |

### Progress Presentations

You will create **seven Class & Office Hours presentations** that summarize your ecosystem discovery and evolving open source ecosystem model. Your slide decks should not contain any proprietary information.

## Team-Provided Systems

We have found that many teams already have a CRM or community management tool that they use regularly. Some use spreadsheets, Google Docs, Microsoft products, etc.

The team will provide the following systems:

1. **Interview Tracking Tool:** A tool to track your interview funnel and completions, from prospect, to first contact, scheduling, and completion. You may use ours or create your own as long as the required information is included.

2. **Interview Insights Tool:** A tool to record your insights from each interview. Some teams have used shared documents or other repositories. Teams have experimented using AI tools like NotebookLM (there are many) and we can only recommend that you do as much data synthesis within your team as possible.
