### DUE Assignment: Finale Session 2

**Due: Mar 5, 2026 7:00 AM**

#### Session Preparation

- Please upload your final slide decks according to the instructions provided. Today we will run strictly on time so please make the upload deadline.
- You will give your presentation largely uninterrupted and then there will be a few comments by your instructors. You will only see one-half of the teams (up to 11 other teams) and we think you will take away a lot from the other presentations. You are required to stay for all of the presentations.
