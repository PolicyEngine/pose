> There are two assignments on this page. Be sure to scroll to the bottom.

### Session Preparation

- **Review the required texts.** Our recommendation is for all team members to skim the books to understand their contents and frameworks. You can dive deeper into the texts as needed over the course.

- **Interviews** - Using your system, or the template that we provided for the [Interview Log](https://venturewell.novoed.com), begin the following process:
  - Create as long a list as possible of potential interviewees. This could be anyone in your ecosystem or people you want to have in your ecosystem.
  - Schedule at least 15 interviews (not during the program hours) for the kickoff week.
  - Begin scheduling more interviews for the following weeks.

- **Get your systems in order.** Make sure you have a team communication tool, data platforms, or other tools that your team will use during the course. Everyone should be zoom capable with a good microphone. You will receive login information for NovoEd - make sure you are able to access that system. Make sure you have your calendar blocked for all class sessions and office hours.
