# PolicyEngine | OSE Thesis

FOR policy researchers, journalists, government analysts, advocacy organizations, benefit access platforms, and citizens across the US and UK

WHO NEED TO understand how tax and benefit policy changes affect households and society—calculating impacts on poverty, inequality, and government budgets—or help individuals understand their own eligibility and optimize their benefit access

THE STATUS QUO of proprietary microsimulation models with restricted access FAILS DUE TO high licensing costs, closed-source "black box" calculations, limited public scrutiny, inaccessibility to non-programmers, and fragmented benefit eligibility tools that don't account for interactions between programs, CAUSING policy debates based on unverifiable claims, duplicated modeling efforts across organizations, exclusion of smaller orgs and citizens from evidence-based policy analysis, and millions in unclaimed benefits

WE WILL DELIVER an open-source tax-benefit microsimulation platform with a web interface for non-programmers, validated calculations against official sources, transparent methodology anyone can audit, APIs for integration into benefit access tools and screeners, and household-level calculators that show eligibility across programs

AND SUSTAIN THE ECOSYSTEM VIA foundation grants (Open Philanthropy, Arnold Ventures), government grants (NSF POSE), earned revenue from custom analysis for think tanks and governments, API partnerships with benefit access platforms, and contributed development from policy-motivated engineers

WE WILL GROW THE COMMUNITY THROUGH documentation and tutorials, contributor onboarding, partnerships with universities and think tanks, API integrations that let benefit platforms build on PolicyEngine, and embedding in benefit access workflows

WE WILL ACHIEVE BROADER IMPACTS in democratized access to policy analysis, more transparent and evidence-based policy debates, reduced barrier to entry for advocacy organizations, improved policy outcomes through better-informed decisions, and increased benefit uptake through better eligibility tools

MEASURE SUCCESS BY number of policy analyses run, academic citations, media references, organizations using the API, households served through benefit access integrations, contributor count, and policy changes informed by PolicyEngine analysis

AND BE GOVERNED BY a nonprofit structure (501c3), open-source licensing (AGPL), transparent roadmap, and community input on feature priorities

## Areas to validate (IDK)

- Governance model details still evolving
- Specific sustainability mix (grants vs. earned revenue ratio)
- Community growth tactics that actually work
- API pricing/partnership model for benefit access platforms
