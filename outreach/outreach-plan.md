## Outreach tracking

Use the POSE Tracker app:
- Log each person as an interview (scheduled/completed)
- Track segment
- Note referrals for snowball sampling

## Calendar scheduling

Set up shared scheduling:
1. Create Calendly/Cal.com account for team
2. Set up 30-min "POSE Ecosystem Interview" event type
3. Share link: cal.com/policyengine/pose-interview (or similar)
4. Connect to team calendars for availability

## Email sending strategy

1. **Personalize first line** - Reference their specific work/connection
2. **Send Tuesday-Thursday** - Best response rates
3. **Follow up after 5 days** - One follow-up only
4. **Track in spreadsheet** - Name, email, sent date, response, scheduled date

## Referral strategy

At end of each interview, ask:
"Who else should we talk to? Anyone in [specific segment] you'd recommend?"

This "snowball sampling" is key to reaching 100.
