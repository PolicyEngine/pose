## Dan's TAXSIM user email (revised)

**Subject:** Help shape the future of TAXSIM - 30 min conversation?

---

Hi [Name],

As you may know, I've retired as IT Director at NBER. While I'll continue supporting TAXSIM independently for years to come, NBER is partnering with PolicyEngine (policyengine.org) to ensure TAXSIM's long-term future.

We're part of an NSF program exploring how to build sustainable open-source tools for policy research. As part of this, we're talking with TAXSIM users to understand:
- How you use TAXSIM in your work
- What would make it more valuable
- Ideas for the future of tax microsimulation tools

**Would you have 30 minutes for a conversation?** Your input directly shapes the direction of these tools.

Schedule a time: [CALENDLY_LINK]

Or just reply to this email and we'll find a time.

Best,
Daniel Feenberg
