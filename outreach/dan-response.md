# Response to Dan

Hi Dan,

Your email is good - I made some tweaks to make it clearer what we're asking for (a conversation, not a formal survey) and what's in it for them. See the revised version in email-templates.md.

**Key answers:**

1. **Yes, all interviews count together.** TAXSIM users + PolicyEngine users + funders + everyone else = one pool toward 100. You don't need to find 15 on your own. If you get 5-10 TAXSIM users, that's excellent. We'll fill in the rest from PolicyEngine's network.

2. **Tuesday prep (Jan 20):**
   - We present slides: Team, Thesis, Assumptions, Interview Log
   - Slides are ready in the tracker: https://pose-tracker-orcin.vercel.app (Slides tab)
   - Download PPT from there if needed
   - Main thing: be ready to introduce yourself and explain your TAXSIM/NBER background

3. **Let's talk Friday** - I'll send a calendar invite. We can:
   - Walk through the slides together
   - Refine your outreach list
   - Set up calendar scheduling for interviews

**For your email:**
- I'd suggest using a scheduling link (Calendly/Cal.com) so people can book directly
- Makes it much easier than back-and-forth emails
- I can help set this up Friday

**TAXSIM user value prop:**
Your users will respond because:
- They depend on TAXSIM and want it to continue
- They may have feature requests they've never voiced
- Being part of shaping the future is appealing to researchers

Let me know if Friday afternoon works for a call.

Max
