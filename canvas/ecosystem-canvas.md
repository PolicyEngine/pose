## Value propositions by segment

### For users (policy analysts, researchers)
- **Transparency**: Open-source means you can audit every calculation, cite methodology in publications
- **Speed**: Run what-if scenarios in seconds vs. weeks waiting for proprietary model access
- **Cost**: Free to use vs. $10K+ annual licenses for comparable tools
- **Integration**: API access lets you embed in your own workflows and tools
- **Credibility**: Validated against official sources (IRS, SSA, CBO)

### For contributors (developers)
- **Impact**: Your code directly affects policy analysis used by Congress, think tanks, journalists
- **Portfolio**: Demonstrate policy domain expertise alongside technical skills
- **Community**: Work with policy experts to understand real-world requirements
- **Learning**: Understand how tax/benefit systems actually work

### For supporters (funders)
- **Leverage**: Fund infrastructure that multiplies impact across many organizations
- **Transparency**: See exactly what your money built (open-source, public roadmap)
- **Ecosystem building**: Create positive-sum dynamics vs. zero-sum competition for proprietary tools

## Key assumptions to test

1. **Think tanks want transparent methodology** - Do they actually value open-source, or do they prefer proprietary models with "brand name" credibility?

2. **Benefit platforms will integrate via API** - Will they build on PolicyEngine or prefer to build/maintain their own rules engines?

3. **Academic adoption requires validation** - What level of validation against official sources is needed before researchers will cite PolicyEngine?

4. **Government economists will engage** - Are government budget offices willing/allowed to use open-source tools?

5. **Contributors exist in policy space** - Are there engineers motivated enough by policy impact to contribute without compensation?

---

## Governance model

**Current**: Founder-led nonprofit (501c3), all code AGPL licensed

**Future**:
- Technical steering committee with community input on roadmap
- Contributor guidelines and code review process
- Formal partnership agreements with major integrators
- Advisory board including academics, policy experts, funder representatives

---

## Sustainability

**Annual costs**: ~$500K (engineering, cloud, operations)

**Funding sources**:
- Foundation grants (Open Philanthropy, Arnold Ventures) - 60%
- Government grants (NSF POSE, other programs) - 20%
- Earned revenue (custom analysis, API partnerships) - 20%

**Path to sustainability**:
- Increase earned revenue share to 40%+ through API partnerships with benefit platforms
- Build contributor base to reduce paid engineering costs
- Establish recurring funder relationships vs. one-time grants
